Built with pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript, it’s a **multiplayer game** where you can:
- Play multiple rounds
- Track your score
- Undo your last move
- Capture the game board as an image

Perfect for learning DOM manipulation, UI design, and basic game logic!

## 📜 Rules

- Two players take turns marking X and O.
- The first to place three marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
